This project aims to get you bootstrapped and started as soon as possible with professional git workflows and continous integration and development.


# Vision
This project is meant to get a beginner into the world of devops and the software development lifecycle. Support will be added for 
<br />
1. Get started with your Docker file for bootstrapping your application. 
2. Add an automated build management system with custom build scripts and testing scripts
3. Configure your system for continous deployment

## Features
 * Docker
 * CircleCI

## Workflow

### Docker

Currently the run command just runs all the tests

1. Build -> ```docker build -t <container-name> . ```
2. Run -> ```docker run -p 3000:3000 <container-name> ```

* Dockerfile gets node image, copies all files in currecnt directory and builds the container

* Building images with tags via versioning ``` docker build -t foo/bar:1.0 ```
* docker-compose.yml is a config file for docker build process, ports, env variables etc
* dockerignore file
* tag git at every release

### Circle CI
 Circle Ci configured under .circleci/config.yml file 

 * On every github event, it builds the docker container and runs it, therby running all the tests

### Git Workflow

* git init
* make develop branch , considered to be a brach for all development
* All feature branches (feature/x-feature) is branched out of the develop branch
* Do work commit like usual
* Every feature in unique branches
* Merge back in develop
* Often pull from develop , in your feature branch
* Rebase from develop branch to keep history intact
* After develop has become stable and ready to release, checkout a release branch always prefixed by release/
* Testing on release branch
* Commit directly to release branch , or submit a pull request to the release branch, from a feature / x branch
* After release branch passes testing , it is then merged back into the develop
* Then code from release/x is merged into master, and a github tag is added
* Hot fix branches for emergency fixes to master, branched from master
